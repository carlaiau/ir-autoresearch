**Legend**
- `MAP`: Mean Average Precision. A single overall ranking-quality score across all queries; higher is better.
- `MAP Δ vs previous`: Change in MAP versus the row above it. Positive is better.
- `P_5` and `P_20`: How many of the top 5 or top 20 results are relevant. Higher means better early precision.
- `Rprec`: Precision after retrieving `R` results, where `R` is the number of relevant documents for that query. Higher is better.
- `bpref`: A relevance metric that is more tolerant of incomplete judgment sets. Higher is better.
- `num_rel_ret / num_rel`: Fraction of all judged-relevant documents that were retrieved anywhere in the run. Roughly, a recall-style coverage signal; higher is better.
- `Index median`: Median wall-clock indexing time in seconds across benchmark runs; lower is better.
- `Search topics median`: Median wall-clock search time in seconds for the full topics file across benchmark runs; lower is better.
